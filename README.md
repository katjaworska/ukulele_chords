### A program for learn &amp; practice ukulele chords

This program was created based on my hobby, which is playing the ukulele.
The purpose is to learn and practice chords by doing exercises.

Main functionality:
- checking specific chords inserted by a user - displaying them in a graphic form;
- doing exercises (not finished yet) - playing along with the program in real time;
- generating a file with all chords or only chosen by the user;


Chords in base are in the format:
```
C [0000][0000][0001][0000]
```
and displays for the user in the format:

```
** C **
_______
|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|
|_|_|_O
|_|_|_|

```
The program will be continuously developed and new functionalities will be added.

Any idea for more functionality? I'd love to hear it!
